# Introduction of Multi-compartment poromechanics for living tissues

This repository contains the functions created in FEniCSx to model the biomechanical response of skin as part of Thomas Lavigne PhD. The here-after functions are consistent with a version 0.9.0 of FEniCSx. 

Please run first `python3 setup.py build` at ./0_Service_files/porous_fenicsx to create the package.
