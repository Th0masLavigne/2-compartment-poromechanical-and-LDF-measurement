# A 2-compartment poromechanical approach to account for the vascular network in human skin: Theoretical developments and comparison to a *in vivo* Laser Doppler Flowmetry measurement.

This repository contains the codes used to generate the results presented in *Lavigne et al.*[^1]. This paper proposes a proof of concept for a poroelastic model to account to simulate the mechanical behaviour and micro-circulation of human skin. A 2-compartment model has been considered and a sensitivity analysis has been performed to study the dominant parameters of the model to reproduce the micro-circulation of *in vivo* human skin, using a porous media approach. The simulation outputs were compared to an experimental campaign (ethical agreement PREVAILXXX). The here-after functions are consistent with a version 0.9.0 of FEniCSx.


Please run first `python3 -m pip install .` at ./Theoretical_developments_and_service_files/0_Service_files/porous_fenicsx to create the package. This allows not to copy paste the service files (modules) but use them directly as a package.

An example for poro-hyper-elastic material is available on the following [link](https://github.com/Th0masLavigne/Skin_porous_modelling). Ongoing work is focused on the enhancement and theoretical improvement/correction for large displacement fields. Corresponding codes will be available as soon as possible.
